=== Supported Constraints
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/nullable.html[nullable]
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/blank.html[blank]
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/creditCard.html[creditCard]
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/email.html[email]
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/inList.html[inList]
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/max.html[max]
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/maxSize.html[maxSize]
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/min.html[min]
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/minSize.html[minSize]
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/range.html[range]
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/size.html[size]
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/url.html[url]
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/matches.html[matches]

=== Unsupported Constraints
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/scale.html[scale]
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/validator.html[validator] - custom validators can have all kinds of business logic in them and there isn't a programmatic way to interrogate this.  If the test value that's tried doesn't pass your logic, you'll need to provide a value, or mock out the calls that the validator makes so that it passes.
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/unique.html[unique] - not directly supported but it's possible to specify your own unique value in a config file as demonstrated on the link:examples[Examples] page.
- {grailsDocBase}/ref/Constraints/notEqual.html[notEqual] - unlikely that our test data would match this, could be supported in the future
